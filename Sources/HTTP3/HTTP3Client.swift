/// HTTP/3 Client (RFC 9114)
///
/// A high-level HTTP/3 client that manages QUIC connections and provides
/// a simple API for making HTTP/3 requests.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Connection pooling** — Reuses connections to the same authority
/// - **Automatic HTTP/3 setup** — Opens control and QPACK streams automatically
/// - **QPACK header compression** — Uses literal-only mode for simplicity
/// - **Concurrent requests** — Multiple requests can be in-flight simultaneously
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let client = HTTP3Client()
///
/// // Simple GET request
/// let response = try await client.request(
///     HTTP3Request(method: .get, url: "https://example.com/api/data")
/// )
/// print("Status: \(response.status)")
/// print("Body: \(String(data: response.body, encoding: .utf8) ?? "")")
///
/// // POST request with body
/// let postResponse = try await client.request(
///     HTTP3Request(
///         method: .post,
///         url: "https://example.com/api/submit",
///         headers: [("content-type", "application/json")],
///         body: Data("{\"key\": \"value\"}".utf8)
///     )
/// )
///
/// // Clean up
/// await client.close()
/// ```
///
/// ## Connection Lifecycle
///
/// When a request is made, the client:
/// 1. Checks for an existing connection to the target authority
/// 2. If none exists, establishes a new QUIC connection
/// 3. Initializes the HTTP/3 layer (control stream, QPACK streams, SETTINGS)
/// 4. Sends the request on a new bidirectional stream
/// 5. Returns the response
///
/// Connections are kept alive for subsequent requests to the same authority.
