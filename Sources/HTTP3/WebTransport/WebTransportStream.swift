/// WebTransport Stream (draft-ietf-webtrans-http3)
///
/// Wraps a QUIC stream to provide WebTransport-scoped stream I/O.
/// Each WebTransport stream is associated with a session via a session ID
/// that is written as the first bytes on the stream.
///
/// ## Stream Types
///
/// WebTransport defines two stream association mechanisms:
///
/// ### Bidirectional Streams
///
/// The initiator opens a QUIC bidirectional stream and writes the
/// session ID as the first varint:
///
/// ```
/// WebTransport Bidirectional Stream {
///   Session ID (i),       // QUIC variable-length integer
///   Stream Body (..)      // Application data
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Unidirectional Streams
///
/// The initiator opens a QUIC unidirectional stream with stream type
/// 0x54 (WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM), followed by the session ID:
///
/// ```
/// WebTransport Unidirectional Stream {
///   Stream Type (i) = 0x54,
///   Session ID (i),
///   Stream Body (..)      // Application data
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Opening a bidirectional stream
/// let stream = try await session.openBidirectionalStream()
/// try await stream.write(Data("Hello".utf8))
/// let response = try await stream.read()
///
/// // Opening a unidirectional stream (send-only)
/// let uniStream = try await session.openUnidirectionalStream()
/// try await uniStream.write(Data("Fire and forget".utf8))
/// try await uniStream.closeWrite()
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// `WebTransportStream` is `Sendable` because it wraps a `Sendable`
/// QUIC stream protocol and holds only immutable metadata.
///
/// ## References
